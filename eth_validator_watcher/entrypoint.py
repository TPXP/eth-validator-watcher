    ðŸš¨ Be alerted when you miss a block proposal / when your attestations are late! ðŸš¨

    \b
    This tool watches the ðŸ¥“ Ethereum Beacon chain ðŸ¥“ and tells you:
    - when you miss a block proposal
    - when some of your attestations are not optimally included in the next slot
    - when some of your attestations are not optimally included in the next slot two
      times in a raw (may indicates there is an issue with this specific key)
    - if one of your keys are about to propose a block in the next two epochs (useful
      when you want to reboot one of your validator client without pressure)

    \b
    You can specify:
    - the path to a file containing the list of public your keys to watch, or / and
    - an URL to a Web3Signer instance managing your keys to watch.

    \b
    Pubkeys are load dynamically, on the first slot of each epoch.
    - If you use pubkeys file, you can change it without having to restart the watcher.
    - If you use Web3Signer, a call to Web3Signer will be done at every slot to get the
    latest keys to watch.

    \b
    Three prometheus probes are exposed:
    - A missed block proposals counter of your keys
    - The rate of non optimal attestation inclusion of your keys for a given slot
    - The number of two non optimal attestation inclusion in a raw of your keys

    Prometheus server is automatically exposed on port 8000.
