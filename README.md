Validator Watcher
=================

Description
-----------

ðŸš¨ Be alerted when you miss a block proposal! ðŸš¨

This tool watches the ðŸ¥“ Ethereum Beacon chain ðŸ¥“ and raises and alert when
a block proposal is missed. It needs to be connected to a beacon node.

You can specify:
- the path to a file containing the list of public your keys to watch, or / and
- an URL to a Web3Signer instance managing your keys to watch

Pubkeys are load dynamically, at each slot.
- If you use pubkeys file, you can change it without having to restart the watcher.
- If you use Web3Signer, a call to Web3Signer will be done at every slot to get the
latest keys to watch.

A prometheus counter named `missed_block_proposals` is automatically increased by 1
when one of your validators missed a block.

Prometheus server is automatically exposed on port 8000.
